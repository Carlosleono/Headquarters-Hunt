# Structure

The structure of this project is composed of:
 1. A folder of notebooks: 
    
    a) **ComparableCompanies.ipynb** -->Where we search in the MongoDB databse "companies" for similar companies (less than 100 employes, startups, mobilegames...). We select the three companies that are more similir to our own to get three cities in which we will be looking for a headquarter

    b) **APIs.ipynb** --> Where we will find places near to our preselect locations that fit the requirements made by the employees.

    c) **Geoqueries.ipynb** --> Where we make geospatial queries to find the distance of each place to our location and make the normalize relation to get the city that best suit our company

    d) **Maps.ipynb** --> Where we draw a map of pour preferred location with the places found near it.

 2. scr folder: folder where we store the functions used in the notebooks
